On stage, her voice resonates deeply with the audience, which has allowed her to amass a large and loyal fanbase known as her \"Astranauts.\" Of course, Astra's brilliance wouldn't be possible without the careful protection of her manager, Evelyn. Offstage, she appears to be just a cute, hapless girl who depends on Evelyn in her daily life, and on Wise and Belle in the Hollows.\n\n\"If I tickled Eous, would it make you laugh?\" Astra asked curiously while lifting the Proxy, who was linked via the HDD system.\n\nShe seems to have a particular fondness for Eous.\nContemplation: Human emotions are indeed an interesting subject. It's still hard to determine whether Astra likes Eous because of the owner, or whether she likes the owner because of Eous.",
